## Make My Deals

This is an entry for freelancer [contest](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/figma-design-optimisation-and-html-code-with-responsive-format-2237143). Just playing around to see if my work would get noticed.

### For the client

If you happen to check out my submission, I made the website using sveltekit and twind (tailwind css) stack. This is just a sample layout so buttons or links will not work except for the avatar dropdown menu and carousel sliders. If you want something more, I am free to have a conversation.
